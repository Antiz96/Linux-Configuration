##Boot into the GParted Live Session to shrink the root partition (if not done already at install)
New size : 20480 Mo for root partition (/dev/sda3)
Then, reboot and create a new partition (/dev/sda4) with the left space (with fdisk) and mount it via the fstab on /nextcloud


##Install Docker on my Debian Proxmox Server (if not done already)
https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/installing-and-using-docker-on-ubuntu-and-debian/

#Make sure docker is not installed on the machine
$ sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io

#Install docker dependencies
$ sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

#Add docker GPG Key and repo
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
$ echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

#Update repo list and install docker
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

#Start and enable the docker service
$ sudo systemctl start docker
$ sudo systemctl enable docker containerd


##Installing Nextcloud on Docker
https://github.com/nextcloud/docker

#Pull and run the container
#This run command contains the mapping to /nextcloud (previously created) to get persistent data for upgrades and backups
#It also contains the Docker "always" restart policy (https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/)
#It will make nextcloud listen to the "8080" port. Make sure you don't have anything already listening to that port (like Apache Guacamole for instance).
#If you do have anything already listening to the 8080, use another one in the below command
$ sudo docker run --name nextcloud -v /nextcloud:/var/www/html -d --restart always -p 8080:80 nextcloud

#You can now access and configure nextcloud on this URL
http://[HOSTNAME]:8080/

##Update/Upgrade and reinstall procedure
Since we use Docker, the update and upgrade procedure is actually the same as it does not rely directly on our server.
Also, if you did a mapping between a volume stored on a local disk (like I did), all you need to do to reinstall your Nextcloud server is to re-download Docker (if you reinstalled your OS completly) and do the following steps.

#Pull docker image to check if there's available updates
$ sudo docker pull nextcloud

#If there's an available update; then stop, delete and re-run the container to apply
$ sudo docker stop nextcloud
$ sudo docker rm nextcloud
$ sudo docker run --name nextcloud -v /nextcloud:/var/www/html -d --restart always -p 8080:80 nextcloud

#After any update, you can clean old dangling docker images (to regain spaces and clean up your local stored Docker images)
$ sudo docker image prune

#Alternatively, you can clean all unused Docker component (stopped containers, network not use by any containers, dangling images and build cache) 
/!\If you choose to do that, make sure all your containers are running ! Otherwise, they will be deleted/!\
$ sudo docker system prune
