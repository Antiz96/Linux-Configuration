##I couldn't resolve DNS addresses of my company when using the VPN.
##Solution below, link for full explanation : https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/589683/wsl-dns-not-working-when-connected-to-vpn

$ sudo vi /etc/wsl.conf #Create the file and put the lines below in it
[network] 
generateResolvConf = false

#Reboot your WSL machine to apply changes

$ sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf #symbolic link automatically created, delete it

$ sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf #Recreates the file with the following it
search    your.domain.com #Change it to your search domain company if needed
nameserver    y.y.y.y     #Your normal local DNS
nameserver    x.x.x.x     #First DNS used by your VPN
nameserver    x.x.x.x     #Second DNS used by your VPN

#Reboot your WSL machine to apply changes and you're done

##At this point, DNS should work when using VPN.
##But you might face a weird issue where DNS resolution are really slow when using the VPN (from 5 to 10 sec before the resolution comes)
##Despite all weird and sketchy "solutions" I found on the internet, I couldn't found one that actually worked for me.
##But I do found an acceptable workaround, which is reducing the DNS timeout to 1 sec

$ sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf #Edit the file
search    your.domain.com 
options timeout:1 #Add this line 
nameserver    y.y.y.y     
nameserver    x.x.x.x     
nameserver    x.x.x.x     

#Reboot your WSL machine to apply changes

##After that, all your DNS resolution will only take 1 sec (not better that working instantly but still better then taking 5 to 10 sec) !
##I'll update that file if I ever find a real fix to that issue.
