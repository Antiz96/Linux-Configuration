PROBLEMS :


Bluetooth USB Dongle (asus BT500) not working correctly :
https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/hy5mx2/bluetooth_adapter_asus_usbbt500_not_working_or/
$ sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/bluetooth-blacklist.conf --->
blacklist btrtl
blacklist btusb
blacklist btintel
blacklist btbcm
#Then install bluetooth USB Dongle Driver (and potentially reboot)


GDM not starting correctly at boot (black screen with blinking white cursor) : 
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GDM#GDM_shows_black_screen_with_blinking_white_cursor
$ sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/gdm.service --> 
[Service]
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 2


Steam font problem :
https://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/864961175388383181/
$ cd ~/.fonts/ (create the folder if it doesn't exists)
$ curl https://support.steampowered.com/downloads/1974-YFKL-4947/SteamFonts.zip -o SteamFonts.zip
$ unzip SteamFonts.zip && rm SteamFonts.zip 


Gnome terminal font problem :
Preferences ---> Profil ---> Colors ---> Uncheck "Use the system theme colors"


Lutris wine doesn't work correctly on games :
$ sudo pacman -S wine
$ sudo pacman -S lib32-lcms2


Bluetooth not working anymore after Kernel update (happens only when using USB Bluetooth Dongle) :
$ sudo systemctl status bluetooth #shows "mars 31 13:11:18 Arch-Linux systemd[1]: Condition check resulted in Bluetooth service being skipped."
Link : https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth#systemd:_Condition_check_resulted_in_Bluetooth_service_being_skipped
Reason : the /sys/class/bluetooth directory has been deleted for some reason.
More analyses : https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=265071
Fix :
$ sudo modprobe btusb #Recreates the directory
$ sudo systemctl restart bluetooth #Restart the bluetooth service correctly
$ install_bluetooth_driver #Reinstalling my bluetooth driver (this is a personal alias that calls a script I did to install/reinstall my bluetooth driver. Link to the script : https://github.com/Antiz96/Bash-Scripts/blob/master/install_bluetooth_driver.sh)


GMD does not have the right Keyboard Layout/the keyboard layout is not defined for X11 :
$ localectl
   System Locale: LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8
       VC Keymap: fr
      X11 Layout: n/a
Link : https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GDM#Keyboard_layout - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg/Keyboard_configuration#Using_X_configuration_files
Fix :
$ localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap fr #localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap "layout" "model" "variant" --> "" for empty
It should create the following file :
$ cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf 
# Written by systemd-localed(8), read by systemd-localed and Xorg. It's
# probably wise not to edit this file manually. Use localectl(1) to
# instruct systemd-localed to update it.
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "system-keyboard"
        MatchIsKeyboard "on"
        Option "XkbLayout" "fr"
EndSection
And now, locatectl should show an input for X11 :
$ localectl 
   System Locale: LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8
       VC Keymap: fr
      X11 Layout: fr
      

Cannot install extensions in Gnome 40.1 even tho they are available for Gnome 40 :
The check version script that compares gnome shell and gnome shell extension still hasn't been updated according to the new version numerotation adopted by Gnome since Gnome 40.
Issue reported here : https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/extensions-web/-/issues/131
Until the script is corrected, you can disable the Gnome shell's version check via dconf-editor.
Tutorial : https://www.maketecheasier.com/disable-extension-version-checks-gnome/
After that, you'll be able to install your missing extensions through EGO (extensions.gnome.org)
Be careful ! Only install extensions tagged available with Gnome 40 to ensure your system stability.
