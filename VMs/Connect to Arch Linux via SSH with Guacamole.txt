##Arch has the last version of OpenSSH which disable some "old" key types.

##As Guacamole hasn't switch to that version yet, it is still using those "old" key types which Arch Linux now rejects by default :
$ journalctl -xe
f√©vr. 09 18:10:35 pihole sshd[1185]: Unable to negotiate with 192.168.1.100 port 59724: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss [preauth]

##In order to be able to connect to Arch Linux via SSH with Guacamole, we need to autorize those type of key
$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[...]
HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa,ssh-dss

$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
