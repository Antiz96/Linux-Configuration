$ source ~/.bashrc


##Install Proxmox
https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Install_Proxmox_VE_on_Debian_11_Bullseye
User Management Part : Create regular user in Datacenter --> Permissions --> User (Linux Pam authentication) and then, add PVEAdmin role in the main "Permission tab"
Linux Bridge Part : In Promox --> System --> Network, edit the actual network card and delete IP/Netmask and Gateway. Once done, create a new "Linux Bridge" card, add the IP/Netmask and Gateway and add the actual network card as the bridge port.


##Add storage for VMs and ISO via the Proxom interface
Datacenter --> Storage
ADD - Type : directory | ID : Backup | Directory : /storage/Backup_VMs | Content : VZDump Backup File
ADD - Type : directory | ID : ISO | Directory : /storage/ISO | Content : ISO Image
ADD - Type : directory | ID : VMs | Directory : /storage/VMs | Content : Disk Image
EDIT local directory --> uncheck "activate" checkbox


##Additionnal configuration

#Modify proxmox repo from "enterprise" to "no-subscription" (as I do not use a subscription for my personal needs, I do not have a subscription key. Therefore, I cannot authenticate to the enterprise repo and use it, leading to an error "401 unauthorized" when performing "apt update").

##Useful informations/tips and general usage of the Proxmox interface

#Datacenter
Sum up --> Gives you a sum up of your datacenter state
Storage --> Manage, delete and create different storage type for different usage (ISO, VMs Disk, Backup, Container, Templates, etc...)
Backup --> Manage, delete, and create backup automatic jobs for your node/VMs
Permissions --> Manage, delete and create users, groups, roles, pools, API Token and realms. Also allow to enable and manage "Two Factor" authentication

#Proxmox (node)
Sum up --> Gives you a sum up of your node state
Shell --> Gives you a shell on your node (ssh)
System --> Gives you a sum up of the different services state
System/Network --> Manage, delete and create Network card, bridge, vlan, etc... (/etc/network/interfaces)
System/DNS --> Manage your DNS (/etc/resolv.conf)
System/Hosts --> Manage your hosts entry (/etc/hosts)
System/Time --> Manage your NTP configuration (chrony.conf)
System/Syslog --> Read the Proxmox's syslog in real time
Disks --> Shows your mounter disks
Tasks History --> Shows the history of tasks that has been performed recently on the node

#ISO (storage)
Sum up --> Gives you a sum up of your storage state
ISO Image --> Upload or Delete ISO(s). Note that you can only upload one ISO at once via the upload form. If I need to upload multiple ISOs from my computer to the Proxmox Server, I use the following command :
/!\It requires a Linux PC running an X11 (Xorg/X) based graphical interface/!\ 
/!\The "rsync" package has to be installed on both the source computer and the Proxmox Server (which should be the case as rsync is installed by default during the Promox installation)/!\
/!\Finally, it needs the "ssh-askpass" packages installed and configured on the Proxmox Server (see the "##Log as general user" part above)/!\
$ rsync -vzPhe "ssh -X" --rsync-path="sudo -A rsync" /run/media/rcandau/data/ISO/* rcandau@Promox:/storage/ISO/template/iso

#VMs (storage)
